You are coding in a prompt-first style. Generate a single TypeScript CLI file.
Task: Incident Triage Assistant.
Requirements:
- CLI menu with 3 options: service down, error spike, latency increase.
- For each option output severity and 4 concrete response steps.
- Support --simulate <1|2|3> to emit JSON (non-interactive) for automation.
- Without --simulate, run interactive mode in terminal.
Constraints:
- Keep code readable and pragmatic.
- Output code only, no markdown fences.
