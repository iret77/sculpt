Compilation failed. Fix the code with minimal changes.
Constraints:
- Remove external dependencies (no inquirer).
- Keep interactive mode using built-in Node APIs only.
- Add `declare const process: any;` to avoid node typings dependency.
- Keep --simulate and all current features including owner_hint and next_update_minutes.
- Return full TypeScript file only.
Errors:
TS2307 Cannot find module inquirer
TS2580 Cannot find name process
